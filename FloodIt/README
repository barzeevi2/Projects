Goal: To implement the Flood-it game using spanning trees, mutable world state, 2d ArrayLists, and mutable linked data structures in Java.


Flood-It is a puzzle game where the player's objective is to fill the entire game board with a single color within a limited number of moves (guesses).
The game board consists of a grid of colored cells. Players start at the top-left corner of the grid and select a color. 
All cells of the same color that are adjacent to the starting cell (vertically or horizontally) become part of the player's territory.
The game continues until the player either conquers the entire board or runs out of allowed guesses.
The player is able to click on each square to change the color.
Player can restart and re-generate a new random board at any time.

It encompasses several main ideas, including the representation of the game board as a 2D array of cells 
(which is the other class and defines each cell), the tracking of game parameters like board dimensions, available colors, 
and guesses, and the management of the game state through methods for handling user interactions, game ticks, and end conditions. 

The FloodItWorld class also handles graphical elements, such as rendering the game board and displaying the score and timer.
