Goal: Create a maze generator game that can be solved using breath or depth-first search.

I used Java to create and visualize randomly generated mazes. I used the Java library javalib.impworld for creating graphical worlds and scenes.
The user can perform various actions based on different inputs while playing the game. The game can be played on boards of all sizes.

The main feature of this algorithm is kruskals algorithm. I used the algorithm in order to find the minimum spanning tree. This minimum spanning tree will be 
the path from start to finish of the maze. The idea is to use randomized weights every time I generate a maze, so that the min spanning tree is different.
