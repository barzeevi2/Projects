Goal: Create a maze generator game that can be solved using breath or depth-first search.

Using Java, I created a maze generator game that the user can restart and solve using BFS or DFS. 
The game uses utilizes the Java library javalib.impworld for creating graphical worlds and scenes. The GUI allows the user to restart the game and move freely within the maze.

I utilized kruskal's algorithm to identify the minimum spanning tree - which will be the path of the maze. 
The idea is to use the algorithm with random weights so that the maze is randomly generated and has one path from start to end - the minimum spanning tree.
